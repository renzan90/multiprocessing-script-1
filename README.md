# multiprocessing-script-1
A basic demonstration of multiprocessing in Python. The program begins with a start-timer and execution of two function calls, that include 'program sleep'. The execution of the timer and the print statements within the function calls happen simultaneiously since the Python interpreter executes both the function calls and the timer's end statement simultaneously, due to multiprocessing.
